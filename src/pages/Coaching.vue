              workouts, and give you a performance boost.

                    Since you have raced before, we can use your most recent

                    improvement you can make over the weeks leading up to your
                    race.

        <p class="text-body1 text-left">
          All EXPONENTIAL RUNNING plans are of a gold standard for both elite
          athletes and recreational runners.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body1 text-left">
          This plans are derived from the theories and practices of the most
          legendary distance running coaches and exercise scientists from around
          the world. Unlike other “cookie-cutter” training plans that just list
          mileage and a general pace, this Exponential Running plans gives you
          essential specifics on how to do workouts at the right intensity for
          the most beneficial training stimuli. Furthermore, it does not follow
          a strict cycle (like most competitor’s plans), because at Exponential
          Running we believe some workouts take longer to recover from and adapt
          to. Therefore sometimes recovery running days are extended and
          shortened appropriately to give you an ideal boost in fitness. Most
          other plans do not take this kind of periodization into consideration.
          Our Exponential Running guideline gives you the information you need
          to make the plan more specific to your needs and the race you’re
          training for.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body1 text-left">
          We realize that great coaching is both a science and an art and we’ve
          used this philosophy (as well as knowledge gained from our own careers
          as runners) along with experience from coaching many others, to create
          a plan that emphasizes consistent, smart progression: A true
          EXPONENTIAL RUNNING experience!
